## Description

Pac-Man is a classic arcade game created by Namco in 1980. In this game, players control a yellow circular character named Pac-Man who must navigate through a maze, consuming pellets while avoiding ghosts.

## Gameplay

Upon starting Pac-Man, the player must navigate Pac-Man through the maze using the arrow keys on their keyboard (up, down, left, right). Pac-Man must consume all the pellets in the maze while avoiding contact with the ghosts. Eating power pellets temporarily allows Pac-Man to turn the tables and chase and consume the ghosts.

## Controls

- Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to move Pac-Man through the maze.
