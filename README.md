## Description

Pac-Man is a classic arcade game created by Namco in 1980. In this game, players control a yellow circular character named Pac-Man who must navigate through a maze, consuming pellets while avoiding ghosts.

## Gameplay

Upon starting Pac-Man, the player must navigate Pac-Man through the maze using the arrow keys on their keyboard (up, down, left, right). Pac-Man must consume all the pellets in the maze while avoiding contact with the ghosts. Eating power pellets temporarily allows Pac-Man to turn the tables and chase and consume the ghosts.

## Features

- **Maze Design:** Intricate maze layouts filled with pellets and obstacles.
- **Pellets:** Small dots scattered throughout the maze that Pac-Man must eat.
- **Power Pellets:** Special pellets that, when eaten, allow Pac-Man to turn the ghosts blue and eat them for extra points.
- **Ghosts:** Four colorful ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde) with unique behaviors that chase Pac-Man.
- **New Map Sprites:** Updated sprites for the map elements.
- **Player Movement:** Smooth movement controls for Pac-Man.
- **Sounds:** Sound effects and music, including iconic Pac-Man sounds.
- **Animations:** Animated sequences for player movement and other in-game actions.
- **Modified Start Screens:** Enhanced start screens for a better user experience.
- **Scoring:** Point calculation system for tracking player scores.
- **Ghost AI:** Implemented behaviors for the ghosts to make their movements challenging.
